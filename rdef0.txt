# -- Definition of redundant internal coordinates ---
# (all indexes are 1-based)
# This input has 5 blocks: bond stretches, bond angles, torsions, oop bends, oop distances.
# Each block starts with a line with a single integer n which is the number of that type of internal coordiantes.
# Each of the following n lines has atom indexes (1-based) defining one internal coordinate.
