# Cartesian coordinates of molecule with mass.
# The first line is "[number of atoms] [irun]"
#   where if irun=0 then abmat.exe will be called and the A and B matrices will be generated, but the iterations to determine Cartesian displacements will not run.
# Each of the following lines is "[atom symbol] [mass] [x] [y] [z]".
