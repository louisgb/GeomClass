# --- Definition of nonredundant (NR) internal coordinates ---
# (all indexes are 1-based)
# The first line is the number of NR internal coordinates.
# The second line has 5 numbers which are the number of *redundant* (R)  bond stretches, bond angles, torsions, oop bends, oop distances.
# The following lines can have two formats:
#   1. "a - b = c - d" where a, b, c, d are integers. It means NR int. coord. a to b are the same as R int. coord. c to d
#   2. Three lines defining one NR internal coordinate. 
#      1st line: two integers "i n", which are "[index of NR int. coord.] [number of R int. coord. to define this NR int. coord.]"
#      2nd line: n integers, which are indexes of R int. coord.
#      3rd line: n real numbers, which are linear combination coefficients of the R->NR transformation.
